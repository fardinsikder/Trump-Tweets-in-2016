Most of his tweets contained a link. Thus, the word "http" appeared a lot. 

I modified the excel file using the code below:

=IFERROR((LEFT(A1,LEN(A1)-(LEN(A1)-(FIND("http",A1,1)-1)))),A1)

This basically removed the links and if there were no links, the original tweet was kept.

The new columnn is called contentmod.
